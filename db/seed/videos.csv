  ppl blame gold farmers for destroying the econemy and letting ppl buy their way
  2 epic, this is true to an extent HOWEVER at the same time it is because these gold
  farmers exist that much of the AH exists and 2 remove them all would crash the AH
  because there would be MUCH fewer farmers now u might say but ppl would farm more
  but id say probz not ppl r LAZY and few ppl who do farm this sort of thing would
  simple get in game rich ENDPARSEFROMHERE

- PARSEFROMHERE Why can't people leave her alone about her accent it's not fake. You
  can kinda tell her american accent is fake in this video at like 0:44-0:47.(Does
  her american voice remind anyone else as Raven from That's so Raven O.o) People
  that are hating her accent are the reason why she hid it in the first place. Which
  is a shame I love accents they are interesting. Anyway like her accent or no she
  CAN sing and has a good attitude which is all that matters and all she needs. ENDPARSEFROMHERE

- PARSEFROMHERE few years ago, two parents went out for dinner. A few hours later,
  the babysitter was calling to ask if she could cover up the clown statue in the
  kids' room, the father said,""Take the kids and get out of the house. We'll call
  the police, we don't have a clown statue."" The ""clown statue"" is really a killer
  that escaped from jail. If you don't post this letter on to 10 videos tonight, the
  clown will be in your bed at 3:00 am with a chainsaw in his hand. ENDPARSEFROMHERE
